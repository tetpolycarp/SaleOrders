Backlogs:
- Fix major bug: first invoice created, it records the created user correctly. However, when another user update the invoice, it reconize the the creator.
- Add the page to load all the histories
- Add the way to restore from any histories as possible.
- Try not to implement Security and store in SQL. Try to store in data file as possible
- order detail, performance for slow when click on the filter
- Make a way to easily track TNTT sale. Either use Good sheet, have column for Checkout amount, return amount, so the amount sold. Then convert that in to the invoice. 
   might need to have another radio button for TNTT and make sure the mobile doesn't break.
- Make master collection to choose and selet which year to load the data

Fix not:
- Update GoogleSheet with the total pickup automatically
- Order #5 doesn't work (Invoice 142 has incorrect data). Therefore, the Paid Amount is blank, so it doesn't display the check amount correctly. Then make the invoice doesn't display in the CheckSheet

- Display Note on the export in Balance sheet
- Create by is wrong, it shows as the last update
